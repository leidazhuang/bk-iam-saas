After registration, the IAM (Identity and Access Management) logic for pulling resources when configuring permissions

**Important Note:**
- The resource type associated with the Action must be registered in the IAM (Identity and Access Management), otherwise the Action will fail to register.
- If the associated resource type is from your own system, you need to register the resource type first
- If the associated resource type is dependent on another system, you need to wait for the dependent system to register the resource type before you can register the Action
